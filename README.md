# BuildMe 🛠️

Another build system. A simple command runner thats it.

# What is BuildMe 🤔️

Well this pretty much sums it up.

# Why???

IDK. I saw this comic and decide that I want my own build system.

And,

- Makefile's are shit.
- Cmake is complicated
- Meson requires two dependencies (Meson and Ninja)
- Bezel, corporate BS

It does come with some feature.

- It is just command runner (Does not give an _f_ about the file or it's mod time)
- It's just python. Anything that work on python work on buildme script.
  - you want a build script that has access to `pandas`, well you can now have it.

# Docs 🧾️

BuildME is still under construction. (Please be patient, follow this project if you are interested)

# Bye....
